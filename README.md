# Cerebrum
Fast and flexible Deep Learning platform written in C++

The platform is under intensive development. Version 0.1 is scheduled for
Tuesday, 21st of April. Stay tuned!

## Using BLAS

While waiting for Cerebrum to be launched, check your BLAS installation.
You need to install [ATLAS](http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/) to have BLAS
support in Cerebrum.

./test_atlas
```
